**Version:** 2.0

**Platform:** Devant WSO2 Integrator (Low-Code)  
**Status:** Refined

## Overview

This document guides creation of a simple HTTP GET endpoint in Devant using low-code only. The endpoint returns a JSON message: "hello from Ballerina integrator".

## Strict Low-Code Rules

- Use only low-code UI elements (Entry Points, Listeners, Connections, etc.).
- Do NOT open or edit any .bal files.
- Do NOT use Show Source or any code view.
- Do NOT modify code directly in the editor.
- If a step requires code, stop and request guidance.

## Waiting and Loading Rules

- After each UI action, wait 2-5 seconds for resources to load.
- If a spinner or loading indicator is visible, wait until it disappears.
- If the UI looks blank or partially loaded, wait and retry after 3 seconds.
- Capture a screenshot only after the UI is fully loaded and stable.

## Notes

- Do not open or use any code views.
- If any step requires code editing, stop and request guidance.

## Troubleshooting

### Low-code panel does not load

Symptoms:
- "There is no data provider registered that can provide view data."
- Add Entry Point dialog does not appear after clicking the button.
- CDN requests fail or are refused.

Actions Taken:
1. Refreshed the editor tab and waited for extensions to load.
2. Closed the editor tab and reopened the integration from the dashboard.

Current Status:
- Low-code panel still unavailable after reload and reopen.
- Further progress requires the low-code view to load.
