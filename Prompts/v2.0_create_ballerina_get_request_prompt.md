**Version:** 2.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-10  
**Last Modified:** 2026-02-10  
**Status:** Refined

## Overview

This prompt guides creation of a simple HTTP GET endpoint in Devant using low-code only. The endpoint returns a JSON message: "hello from Ballerina integrator".

## Objectives

1. Login to Devant platform
2. Create HTTP GET endpoint using low-code UI elements only
3. Configure response payload
4. Test the endpoint
5. Document each step with screenshots

## Strict Low-Code Rules (Mandatory)

- Use only low-code UI elements (Entry Points, Listeners, Connections, etc.).
- Do NOT open or edit any .bal files.
- Do NOT use Show Source or any code view.
- Do NOT modify code directly in the editor.
- If a step requires code, stop and request guidance.

## Waiting and Loading Rules

- After each UI action, wait 2-5 seconds for resources to load.
- If a spinner or loading indicator is visible, wait until it disappears.
- If the UI looks blank or partially loaded, wait and retry after 3 seconds.
- Capture a screenshot only after the UI is fully loaded and stable.

## Key Requirements

- **Platform:** Devant (Low-Code)
- **Language:** Ballerina
- **Request Type:** HTTP GET
- **Response Body:** "hello from Ballerina integrator"
- **Implementation:** Low-Code Only (no pro-code)
- **Documentation:** Markdown format with screenshots
- **Screenshots Directory:** screenshots/v2.0/
- **Workflow Document Directory:** workflow-docs/

## Screenshot Versioning Rules

- Before capturing any screenshots, create a new versioned directory like screenshots/v2.0/.
- Remove any previous version screenshot directories (for example, screenshots/v1.0/) to avoid mixing versions.
- Save all screenshots only inside the current versioned directory.
